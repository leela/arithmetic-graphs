# Arithmetic Graphs

Simple project that generates arithmatic graphs from the random numbers sequence. I have one fastAPI application that simply returns the random numbers sequence and another streamlit application that takes the numbers and generate a simple graph. This project is to demonstrate how to run your project on Docker Compose. 


Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:leela/arithmetic-graphs.git

```

Start the dev instance:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
